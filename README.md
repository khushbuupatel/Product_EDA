# Product_EDA

The .ipynb file performs exploratory data analysis on the product_a.csv.  
Insights and patterns are obtained by performing statistical analysis and different user-interactable visualizations using Plotly library.  
Also, a Choropleth map from Folium library is plotted using GeoJson coordinates fetched from Google, ArcGIS and HERE apis to represent item data location wise.
